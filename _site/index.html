        <p>Dear Friends <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Family,</p>
        <p>Wow! Is it already the end of 2014?! Time has flown by since we found out we were pregnant last October. I guess babies have that effect on you.</p>
        <p>Becoming parents has been the greatest adventure of our lives! Bennett is a happy and sweet 6-month-old baby, and we are enjoying watching him grow. He is starting to learn to crawl and is enjoying finding out there is more to eat than just milk. He has definitely brought joy to our little family!</p>
        <p>In addition to having our first baby, we also purchased our first home. We signed the papers a month before Bennett was born! It has 3 bedrooms and 2 baths. It’s the perfect size for our family.</p>
        <p>Phillip is still enjoying his work as a developer at Oven Bits in Dallas, despite the commute. However, he is now able to work from home a few days out of the week (this was an answer to prayer). </p>
        <p>Caitlin has decided to be a stay at home mom. She loves getting to spend her days taking care of Bennett. Although the pay is not much to talk about, her boss is super cute! :)</p>
        <p>Some things we’d like for you to keep in your prayers for us: A new family car that is more dependable and practical for our growing family; wisdom and perseverance in becoming debt-free; and wisdom and discernment in raising Bennett. </p>
        <p>We’re so thankful for your love and friendship. May God bless you richly this holiday season. Merry Christmas!</p>
        <p>With Love,</p>
        <p><strong>Phillip, Caitlin <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Bennett Ridlen</strong><br/>
